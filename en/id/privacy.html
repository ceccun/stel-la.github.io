            </p>
            <p>These interactions are listed below:</p>

                <li>

            <h1>Blocks Privacy</h1>
            <p>
                Stella offers an opt-in service called Blocks, which hosts
                either Blocks or Blocks Nano by Ceccun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blocks receives queries you make to Stella search and gives them
                additional processing using the Blocks model.
            </p>
            <p>When Blocks receives your queries, it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Uses natural language recognition to convert your query into
                    information a computer can understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uses that information to make additional search requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Processes the information through a chosen model (Blocks
                    Nano for Stella ID users)
                </li>
                <li>Returns the output back to you</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Blocks reprocesses your queries into its models to improve
                itself and ensure that it can better process another query of
                the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                To verify its retraining, you may be asked questions on Stella
                search about your experience, which will display your search
                query as well as what Blocks interpreted of it.
            </p>
            <!-- <h2>Human intervention on Blocks</h2>
            <p>
                Information that has been processed by Blocks is visible to
                Ceccun and is processed manually.

                servers. Because of differences in how devices incorporate and
                activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
                intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even
                are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response

            <h1>Children</h1>
            <p>
                The privacy of users under the age of 13 (“Younger Users”) is
                important to us. We attempt to minimise all data collection so
                we do not have any ways to distinguish a Younger User.
