So I'm just using it for my personal site.</p><h3>Check the code ðŸ˜²</h3><p>If you view-source this page, you'll see it looks super simple, that's because it is simple! FLSE is a really cool, easy engine so that's why I keep wanting you to use it. In fact, here's the GitHub link! <a href='https://github.com/stel-la/flse'>FLSE on GitHub</a>.<br>There's not much I can really say here other than the fact that I'm working at Dot HQ currently, but I still update Stella and work hard to put out features for it.</p><h3>Check out other sites!</h3><p>This is a list of sites I recommend checking out: </p><el><li><a href='https://nhofer.xyz/'>nhofer.xyz</a> - Good friend of mine and their site is built on top of FLSE! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©</li><li><a href='https://stella.hs.vc'>The Stella Project</a> - A cloud ecosystem I'm developing. Not much else I can say apart from the fact that I have to really ration my time with the work I do at Dot rather than work on Stella.</li><li><a href='https://new.dothq.co'>Dot HQ</a> - DotHQ is epic, what do they do? I have no idea, but this is where I currently work and where I love working. Make sure to pay them a nice visit.</li><li><a href='https://vicr123.com/'>Victor Tran</a> - Real cool stuff going on here, such a sexy DE and a sexy music player.</li></el><h3>erm...</h3><p>This site did use to look cool, but I just wanted an excuse to test FLSE's new features using it hehe. :D</p>"
